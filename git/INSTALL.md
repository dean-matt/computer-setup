# Installing Git

I prefer to use non-Apple git, to install it:

1. Follow the steps at https://git-scm.com/download to download (I typically use Homebrew, see [Installing Homebrew](../shell/INSTALL_PACKAGE_MANAGERS.md#homebrew) to do that)
2. Check to see which git is being used by running `which git`, this should be located in `/opt/homebrew/bin/git`
